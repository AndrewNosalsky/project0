                <h2>That's my dad</h2>
                Space rocket ingeneer. When I start to walk I find out two things: dad is busy and I shoodn't bother him. Now Ilon Mask keep saing that our rokets are the best in the world. Excluding his BFR. So now I understend why I didn't see my father's face when I was a child. Just his tight and strong closed cabinet door.

                <h2>That's my father's job</h2>
                Hi is dead now. More than tventy years. And now just a few people in the world know what he did. All of them are old. And when all the secrecy passed by I can say: more then 50% weight evrything flying around the earth was pushed up by his physics research and you know what. This picture is the one and only place in internet where his name was mentioned.

                <h2>How it looks now</h2>
                That's how it finally looks like. If you remember the sise of first space rokets you realize it's starts noticeably grow down for last 45 years. And it's the small part of my father's development is pushing up everything that flies to the space now. That's what he did. So pleace pleace when you gona next time use TV, internet or a weather forecast just remember that somebody lived his life to do this.
